To calculate the correlation coefficient, you can use the following formula:

r = (Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)]) / sqrt([Σ(Xi - X̄)²] * [Σ(Yi - Ȳ)²])

Here's a breakdown of the variables used in the formula:

Xi and Yi: The individual values of the two variables being analyzed.
X̄ and Ȳ: The means (averages) of the Xi and Yi values, respectively.
Σ: The sum of the values over the given range of data.
